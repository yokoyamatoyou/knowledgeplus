# Integration Plan

This document outlines the major phases for integrating the knowledge base builder with the Knowledge GPT application.

## Analysis
- **Objective:** Review existing code and define the overall approach for combining the two apps.
- **Key tasks:**
  - Inspect repository structure and dependencies.
  - Identify overlapping functionality and integration points.
  - Decide on shared configuration and environment setup.

## Upload and Processing
- **Objective:** Handle user uploads and convert them into a format suitable for search.
- **Key tasks:**
  - Accept text and image files via the interface.
  - Run OCR and text extraction if needed.
  - Segment and embed content for efficient retrieval.

## Knowledge Base Integration
- **Objective:** Store processed items in a unified knowledge base.
- **Key tasks:**
  - Save metadata and embeddings to the local storage layer.
  - Maintain links between original files and processed data.
  - Update indexing so that the chatbot can access new entries.

## FAQ Generation
- **Objective:** Automatically create frequently asked questions from the knowledge base.
- **Key tasks:**
  - Analyze content for common topics.
  - Generate question and answer pairs with GPT.
  - Store generated FAQs for reference within the app.

## Local Storage
- **Objective:** Keep all data on disk so that the app can run offline.
- **Key tasks:**
  - Organize uploads, metadata and embeddings in a predictable directory layout.
  - Provide utilities for backup and restore.

## User Interface
- **Objective:** Offer a streamlined UI that unifies upload, search and chat features.
- **Key tasks:**
  - Merge builder and chatbot components into a single Streamlit app.
  - Expose upload and FAQ options alongside the chat interface.

## Testing
- **Objective:** Verify that each phase works as expected and that the combined app remains stable.
- **Key tasks:**
  - Unit test new utilities and data handling logic.
  - Run end-to-end tests for the full upload-to-chat workflow.
  - Collect feedback and fix any issues.
